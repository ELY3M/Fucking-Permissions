# Fucking-Permissions


HUGE FUCK YOU TO the android devs making things so complicated!  
They deserved to be laid off.    

This app do not popup permission dialog as it was supposed to do at the start.  

I am on android 13 on my two phones.     
1. Pixel 6 
2. Samsung S22+ - LAST Shitty Samsung phone for me.....     


Pissed off dev
